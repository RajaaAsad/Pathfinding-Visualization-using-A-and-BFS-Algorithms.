# pathFinding_using_A_star
 Pathfinding Visualization using A* and BFS Algorithms.

This software application is designed to determine the shortest path between a specified start spot and an end spot, considering any obstacles you designate. 
To utilize the program, select the desired start and end spots, as well as any barriers you wish to include. 
Once configured, you can initiate the algorithm of your choice by pressing 'A' for the A* algorithm or 'B' for the BFS algorithm.

I initially developed the first version using the A* algorithm, and subsequently implemented updates to create version 2, 
incorporating the following features:

1. If there is no path from the start spot to the end spot, the program will print "NO Path".
2. After running the algorithm, the program will print the actual total cost of the path.
3. For the A* algorithm, the program will print the F function for each iteration and each neighbor.
4. To select an algorithm, press 'A' to run the A* algorithm or 'B' to run the BFS algorithm.
