# pathFinding_using_A_star
Path Pathfinding Visualization using A* and BFS Algorithms 
This program finds the shortest path from a start spot to an end spot, taking into account any barriers you specify. 
To use the program, choose the start and end spots and any barriers you want. 
Then, press 'A' to run the A* algorithm or 'B' to run the BFS algorithm.

I initially developed the first version using the A* algorithm, and subsequently implemented updates to create version 2, 
incorporating the following features:

1. If there is no path from the start spot to the end spot, the program will print "NO Path".
2. After running the algorithm, the program will print the actual total cost of the path.
3. For the A* algorithm, the program will print the F function for each iteration and each neighbor.
4. To select an algorithm, press 'A' to run the A* algorithm or 'B' to run the BFS algorithm.
